Natron is a free open-source (GPLv2 license) video compositing
software, similar in functionality to Adobe After Effects, Nuke by The
Foundry, or Blackmagic Fusion. It is portable and cross-platform (GNU/Linux, OS X, Microsoft Windows). To learn more, go to Natron's [Github](https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron).

This repository contains several UI themes for Natron that aim to enhance Natron's UI and user experience. 

* Material Dark Theme
* Material Light Theme
* Cobalt Theme
* Midnight Theme
* Ocean Theme
* Pale Moon Theme

Help wanted

Installing
----------

To install these themes, following these simple steps:

### Step 1

### Step 2

### Step 3


Requirements
------------

A machine running one of the supported operating systems (GNU/Linux, OS X,
Microsoft Windows), and a 32-bits x86 or 64-bits x86-64 processor.

An OpenGL 2.0 compatible graphics card is needed to run Natron (2.1+) with hardware-accelerated rendering. Other graphics cards work with software-only rendering (see below).

The following graphics cards are supported for hardware-accelerated rendering:

* Intel GMA 3150 (Linux-only)
* Intel GMA X3xxx (Linux-only)
* Intel GMA X4xxx (Windows 7 & Linux)
* Intel HD (Ironlake) (Windows 7 & Linux)
* Intel HD 2000/3000 (Sandy Bridge) (Windows 7/Linux/Mac)
* Intel HD 4000 and greater (All platforms)
* Nvidia GeForce 6 series and greater
* Nvidia Quadro FX and greater
* Nvidia Quadro NVS 285 and greater
* ATI/AMD Radeon R300 and greater
* ATI/AMD FireGL T2-64 and greater (FirePro)

On Windows and Linux you can enable software rendering. On Linux, enable the environment variable LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 before running Natron. On Windows, enable the legacy hardware package in the installer.
