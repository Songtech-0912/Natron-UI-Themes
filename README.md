Natron is a free open-source (GPLv2 license) video compositing
software, similar in functionality to Adobe After Effects, Nuke by The
Foundry, or Blackmagic Fusion. It is portable and cross-platform (GNU/Linux, OS X, Microsoft Windows). To learn more, go to Natron's [Github](https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron).
